<h1>PacMen</h1>

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p>During the week 7, we had to create a web page that produces a PacMan on the click of a button. Each of the PacMan move at their own pace. We had to use the array methods and the new techniques we have learned for manipulating the DOM.</p>

<h2>How to run</h2>
<ul>
<li>Clone the repository into your local environment</li>
<li>Open the index.html file</li>
<li>Right click and select 'Open Default browser' to open the project in your default browser. </li>
<li>Click 'Add PacMan'button to generate a pacman on the page</li>
<li>Click 'Start Game' button to make the pacman move on the screen</li>
</ul>

<h3>Roadmap of future improvements</h3>
<p>Make Pacmen change face direction when he hit x axis limit.</p>
