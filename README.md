# PacMen
During the week 7, we had to create a web page that produces a PacMan on the click of a button. Each of the PacMan move at their own pace. We had to use the array methods and the new techniques we have learned for manipulating the DOM.


Roadmap: 
My improvement will be to make Pacmen change face direction when he hit x axis limit.
